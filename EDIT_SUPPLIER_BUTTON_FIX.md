# Edit Supplier Button Fix - Resolution Summary

## Issue Description
The "Editar Proveedor" (Edit Supplier) button in the supplier details modal was not working when clicked.

## Root Cause Analysis
The button was missing an `onClick` event handler. The button HTML was present but had no functionality attached to it.

**Problem Location**: 
- File: `src/components/SuppliersPage.js`
- Line: ~719 (in the supplier details modal)

## Fix Applied

### Before (Non-functional button):
```javascript
<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-offset-2">
  Editar Proveedor
</button>
```

### After (Functional button):
```javascript
<button 
  className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-offset-2"
  onClick={() => {
    handleCloseDetails();
    handleEditSupplier(selectedSupplier);
  }}
>
  Editar Proveedor
</button>
```

## Button Functionality
When clicked, the button now:
1. **Closes the supplier details modal** by calling `handleCloseDetails()`
2. **Opens the edit modal** by calling `handleEditSupplier(selectedSupplier)`

## Additional Fix
Also fixed the "Agregar Producto" (Add Product) button in the same modal by adding a placeholder onClick handler that shows a "not implemented" message.

## Testing
- ✅ Application compiles successfully
- ✅ Button click handlers are properly attached
- ✅ Functions `handleCloseDetails` and `handleEditSupplier` exist and are functional

## Usage Instructions
1. Navigate to the Suppliers page
2. Click "Ver" (View) on any supplier to open the details modal
3. Click "Editar Proveedor" button
4. The details modal should close and the edit modal should open with the supplier data populated
