# RBAC Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the complete Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation for the Aqualiquim project.

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Created Tables:
- **roles**: Defines system roles (admin, manager, staff, viewer)
- **permissions**: Lists all available permissions
- **role_permissions**: Maps roles to their permissions
- **user_roles**: Assigns roles to users

### Key Permissions:
- `manage_employees`: Create, edit, delete employees
- `manage_finance`: Access financial data and transactions
- `view_reports`: View analytics and reports
- `manage_orders`: Handle order processing
- `manage_inventory`: Manage stock and products
- `manage_roles`: Assign roles to users (admin only)

## 🔧 Core Services

### rbacService.js
- `initialize()`: Sets up RBAC system and assigns default admin role
- `hasPermission(permission)`: Checks if current user has specific permission
- `hasRole(role)`: Checks if current user has specific role
- `getUserRoles()`: Gets all roles for current user
- `assignRole()`: Assigns role to user
- `removeRole()`: Removes role from user

## ⚛️ React Integration

### RBAC Hook (`useRBAC.js`)
- `RBACProvider`: Context provider for RBAC state
- `useRBAC()`: Hook to access RBAC context
- `usePermission(permission)`: Hook to check specific permission
- `useRole(role)`: Hook to check specific role

### ProtectedRoute Component
- Wraps components requiring specific permissions
- Shows access denied message for unauthorized users
- Supports both permission and role-based protection

## 🛡️ Protected Components

### Pages with RBAC Protection:
1. **EmployeesPage**: Requires `manage_employees` permission
2. **FinancePage**: Requires `manage_finance` permission
3. **ReportsPage**: Requires `view_reports` permission
4. **RoleManagementPage**: Requires `manage_roles` permission (admin only)

### Permission-Based UI Controls:
1. **LayoutSidebar**: Filters menu items based on permissions
   - Admin-only sections: Roles, Audit logs
   - Permission-based filtering using `isItemAllowed()` function

2. **DashboardPage**: Disables stat cards based on permissions
   - Sales reports: Requires `view_reports`
   - Orders management: Requires `manage_orders`
   - Inventory alerts: Requires `manage_inventory`

## 🔒 Security Features

### Access Control:
- Component-level protection with ProtectedRoute
- Function-level permission checks
- UI element visibility control
- Navigation restriction based on permissions

### Default Roles:
- **Admin**: Full system access
- **Manager**: Business operations access
- **Staff**: Limited operational access
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

### Row Level Security (RLS):
- Database-level security policies
- User isolation at data level
- Secure data access patterns

## 📋 Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed:
- [x] Database schema created
- [x] RBAC service implementation
- [x] React hooks and context providers
- [x] ProtectedRoute component
- [x] Role management admin interface
- [x] Protected critical pages
- [x] Permission-based UI controls
- [x] Sidebar menu filtering
- [x] Dashboard stat card protection

### 🔄 Next Steps:
1. Run `rbac_schema.sql` in Supabase to create tables
2. Initialize default roles and permissions
3. Test user role assignments
4. Verify permission-based access control
5. Add more granular permissions as needed

## 🚀 Usage Example

```jsx
// Check permission in component
const canManageEmployees = usePermission('manage_employees');

// Protect entire component
<ProtectedRoute requiredPermission="manage_finance">
  <FinancePage />
</ProtectedRoute>

// Conditional UI rendering
{canViewReports && (
  <button onClick={() => navigate('/reports')}>
    View Reports
  </button>
)}
```

## 🔍 Testing RBAC

1. **Admin User**: Should have access to all features
2. **Manager User**: Should access business operations but not user management
3. **Staff User**: Should have limited access to assigned functions
4. **Viewer User**: Should only view data without modification capabilities

## 📞 Integration Points

- **Authentication**: Integrates with existing `AuthContext`
- **Database**: Uses Supabase client from `supabaseClient.js`
- **Routes**: Works with existing routing in `Dashboard.jsx`
- **Components**: Seamlessly integrates with existing component structure

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### Adding New Permissions:
1. Add permission to database
2. Update role_permissions mapping
3. Use permission in components with `usePermission()`

### Adding New Roles:
1. Create role in database
2. Assign appropriate permissions
3. Update UI to handle new role behavior

This RBAC implementation provides a solid foundation for secure, role-based access control throughout the Aqualiquim application.
